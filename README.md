Hello everyone! You can call me Alanik! Of course, that's not my real name (I'd prefer to keep that a secret). I am totally new to GitHub and have no idea what any of these buttons do. (Though I really want to press them all for the fun of it ðŸ˜…)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on resisting the urge to press any and all the buttons on my screen 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything and everything there is to learn (I am a SPONGE! ðŸ§½)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about cats! I love cats! :octocat:
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: lilia.dostie@socprep.org
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that every iPhone commercial has 9:41 set as the time? That's because that was the exact time Steve Jobs released the iPhone. Don't believe me? Look up a few iPhone commercials! ðŸ“±
